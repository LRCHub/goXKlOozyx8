Rastis! Rastis! Ra-ti-ti-la

Let's start a new life from the darkness
Until the light reveals the end
Fear, hatred, sorrow, desperation
Even you look miserable
Look down from above
I feel awful
The time has come
Let's all go home
Sinister faces, growing curses
This is my last war

Ba-ba-ri-as-ras-ti-ti-ta (with devil's faces)
Ba-ba-ri-as-ras-ti-ti-ti-ras-ti-ti (Children cling to their coins)
Rastis! Rastis! Ra-ti-ti-la (squeezing out their wisdom)

Ba-ba-ri-as-ras-ti-ti-ti-ras-ti-ti (Children cling on to their)
Rastis! Rastis! Ra-ti-ti-la (very last coins)

Destruction and regeneration
You are the real enemy (Rastis! Rastis! Rastis!)

The only memory left is trauma
Imaginary friend's kind words
The evening train was shaking
I purified the imperfect flowers
The pain in my heart getting higher
My comedy show at its peak
The frogs were crying on our way home
This is my last war
