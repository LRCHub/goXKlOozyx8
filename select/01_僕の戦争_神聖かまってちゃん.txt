La-la-la-la
Ba-ba-ri-as, ra-ti-ti-ti-ras-ti-ti
Ba-ba-ri-as, ra-ti-ti-ti-ta
Ba-ba-ri-as, ra-ti-ti-ti-ras-ti-ti
Ras-tis! Ras-tis! Ra-ti-ti-la

Let's start a new life from the darkness
Until the light reveals the end
Fear, hatred, sorrow, desperation
Even you look miserable

Look down from above
I feel awful
The time has come
Let's all go home
Sinister faces, growing curses
This is my last war

Angels playing disguised with devil's faces
Children cling to their coins, squeezing out their wisdom
Angels planning disguised with devil's faces
Children cling on to their very last coins
Destruction and regeneration
You are the real enemy

The only memory left is trauma
Imaginary friend's kind words
The evening train was shaking
I purified the imperfect flowers

The pain in my heart getting higher
My comedy show at its peak
The frogs were crying on our way home
This is my last war

Angels playing disguised with devil's faces
Children cling to their coins, squeezing out their wisdom
Angels planning disguised with devil's faces
Children cling on to their very last coins
Destruction and regeneration
You are the real enemy

Tu-tu-tu...

帰り道を無くした風景
夕焼けこやけ逆さまに
下校時間 鳴きだすチャイムと
だんだんと落っこちてゆく

帰り道を終わらせないって
泣いていいよ今だけは
線路沿いに消えちゃった菜の花
来年また咲いてなんて

帰り道を無くした風景
夕焼けこやけ逆さまに
下校時間 他人の影踏み
気づいたら夜明け 1人きり

1人きりを終わらせないって
泣いていいよ今だけは
明日の準備がどうせまたあるし
宿題やって寝なくちゃね
寝なくちゃね

War!
My war!
My war!
Ras-tis! Ras-tis! Ras-tis! Ras-tis!
